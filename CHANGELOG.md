# Changelog

Every change to glance gets a new version number, shown at the bottom of the home screen.

Numbers follow `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`:

- **Major**: a big change to how the game works.
- **Minor**: a new feature.
- **Patch**: a fix or small tweak.

To release a change, bump `version` in both `app.json` and `package.json`, then add an entry at the top of this file.
